          The materials on Fitbiter's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Fitbiter makes no
          warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties
          including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other
          violation of rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          Further, Fitbiter does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy,

      <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        In no event shall Fitbiter or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without
        limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out
        of the use or inability to use the materials on Fitbiter's website, even if Fitbiter or a
        Fitbiter authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility
        of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties,
        or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may
        not apply to you.
