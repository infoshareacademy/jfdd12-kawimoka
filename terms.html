    <h2>Fitbiter Terms of Service</h2>
    <h3>1. Terms</h3>
    <p>By accessing the website at <a href="fitbiter.html">http://fitbiter.com</a>, you are agreeing to be bound by
      these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance
      with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or
      accessing this site. The materials contained in this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark
      law.</p>
    <h3>2. Use License</h3>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on
        Fitbiter's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a
        transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
          <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
          </li>
          <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Fitbiter's website;</li>
          <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
          <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by
        Fitbiter at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license,
        you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The materials on Fitbiter's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Fitbiter makes no warranties, expressed
        or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied
        warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of
        intellectual property or other violation of rights.</li>
      <li>Further, Fitbiter does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or

    </ol>
    <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
    <p>In no event shall Fitbiter or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for
      loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials
      on Fitbiter's website, even if Fitbiter or a Fitbiter authorized representative has been notified orally or in
      writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
      warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply
      to you.</p>
